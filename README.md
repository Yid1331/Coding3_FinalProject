## Project Overview
The project name is Time Tunnel, which aims to use the relevant knowledge and tools of machine learning (image generation of the StylGAN2 model and the application of interactML) to carry out a creative work.
During my study of machine learning, I found that the images generated by the StyleGAN2 model are a process from abstract graphics to realistic objects. This is very similar to the physical representation of memory in my mind. So I want to use StyleGAN2 to generate images of several representative items representing important stages in a person's life to express the memory fragments in a person's mind. The stages and representative items of life are as follows:
