## 01 Project Overview
The project name is Time Tunnel, which aims to use the relevant knowledge and tools of machine learning (image generation of the **StylGAN2** model and the application of **interactML**) to carry out a creative work.

During my study of machine learning, I found that the images generated by the StyleGAN2 will go through a process from abstract to concrete. This is very similar to the physical representation of memory in my mind. So I want to use **StyleGAN2** to generate representative items representing different stages of life. Then put these “memory fragments” into the time tunnel to bring people's memories.

After that, I used **interactML** to train the position of the lens, so that the "memory fragments" can be flickered in the time tunnel, and the lights in the time tunnel will also change color with the change of the lens position.
